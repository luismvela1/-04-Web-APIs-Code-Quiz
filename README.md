# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz


This week consisted of putting together a code quiz using javascript to perform functions that allowed the user to chose the correct answer to a question presented to them and then have the ability to record their score and be able to see the highest score to date.
i first sarted with the question variable arrays that held the questions and avaialble choices and as well held the correct answer.
i also made vars for the functions svcores and timers.
i then made functions to start the timer once the start button was pressed,a fuction that stops the timer at the end of the game,a function that stores the scores a function that clears the score if the clear score button is pressed a function to reset the game, a function that reduces the time by by 15 seconds if the wrong answer is pressed, a function that incresses the points by 20 points if the correct answer is chosen and a function that creates the buttons that hold the choices that the user uses to chose the correct answer in the quiz.
